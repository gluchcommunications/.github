# GLUCH Communications

GLUCH Communications stands for ahead of change. <br> <br>
Through our in-house research and development laboratories, we conduct early-stage analysis of new technologies, either independently or in collaboration with various manufacturers. With the benefit of our extensive experience gained from numerous national and global projects, we are able to constantly remain ahead of the curve.
<br>
Our primary research focus is on achieving multi-vendor interoperability in messaging, meeting and calling, thereby facilitating integration and co-existence between vendors. In this regard, we test the ability to migrate and transform from one technology or vendor to another.

We also devote our research efforts to the development of enterprise collaboration and communication prototypes for modern applications, bots and integrations, as well as cognitive collaboration solutions. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are essential components of our research initiatives.
